# Distance and Borders Effects in International Trade

This repository contains all codes to replicate the empirical results in "Distance and Border Effects in International Trade: A Comparison of Estimation Methods", Economics 2016, by Glenn Magerman, Katrien De Bruyne and Jan Van Hove.

Feel free to send a line to glenn.magerman@ulb.be for any questions or comments.

Data for the project is obtained from [BACI/CEPII](http://www.cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/presentation.asp?id=1).
We have also reformatted the data used in [Anderson and van Wincoop (2003)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321455214) on US-Canada trade to Stata format (not used in the published version).

All code is written in Stata, and all do-files are available in this repo. 

Some important notes:

You might need a Comtrade license to get access to the BACI/CEPII trade datasets.
